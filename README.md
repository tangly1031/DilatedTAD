# DilatedTAD: Enhancing Adaptability to Actions of Varying Durations for Temporal Action Detection

DilatedTAD is a temporal action detection framework that improves long- and short-duration action localization by using multi-branch dilated Mamba modules and bidirectional modeling. It effectively balances temporal context and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.
